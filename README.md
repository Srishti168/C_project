# Swaps Counter C Project

This is a simple C project that demonstrates the usage of static headers to count the number of swaps in a program.

## Introduction

This project provides an example of how to create static headers that can count the number of swaps performed during sorting algorithms. It includes a `swap_counter.h` header that defines macros for counting swaps. The project also includes an example implementation in `main.c` that uses the `swap_counter.h` header to count swaps during a simple sorting algorithm.

## Usage

To use this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory.

## Files

The project consists of the following files:

- `main.c`: This is the main C file that contains an example sorting algorithm implementation using the `swap_counter.h` header.
- `swap_counter.h`: This header file defines macros to count swaps during sorting operations.

## Compilation

To compile the example code, follow these steps:

1. Open a terminal in the project directory.
2. Run the following command to compile the code:
